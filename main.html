          <p class="main-text-h2">About Me</p>
          <p class="main-text">
            I am between 23 and 24 years old. My pronouns are usually she/her, but recently I've been liking the sound of it/its. My main interests include: 
            <ul class="main-text-list">
              <li><b>Research</b>: I will be getting a PhD. I consider research and science to be an important part of my identity.</li> 
              <li><b>Computers</b>: I love the logic and utility of computers. I like that complicated tasks can be reduced to simple concepts, and that those simple concepts can be defined or proven with concrete terms. 
                <ul class="main-text-list" style="padding-top: 0">
                  <li><b>Software</b>: My primary interests are in programming. I like the accessibility of software, and the ability of abstraction to allow all sorts of programs and modifications of systems to be done.</li>
                  <li><b>Hardware</b>: My research is in hardware design. I love the rigidity of hardware, and how the operation of the software can be explained by looking closely at the hardware.</li> 
                  <li><b>Programming Languages</b>: I like to study programming languages. My bachelor's thesis had been to invent a language, and I'm trying to find ways to integrate domain-specific languages in my research.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><b>Sh≈çnen</b>: I like to watch anime and read manga, and shonen is the genre I like the most. I want to get really strong and powerful like Goku.</li> 
              <li><b>Sweets</b>: I have a big sweet tooth. I love to eat cookies and drink hot cocoa. My favorite cookies are the frosted sugar cookies from Walmart.</li>  
            </ul> 
          </p>

            I'm a shy person, and I sometimes have periods where I'm not very talkative. If that doesn't discourage you, then feel free to send me a message on the following platforms:
