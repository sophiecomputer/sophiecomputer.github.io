            hi. this is a weird post. i had a coherent idea going into it, and i
            was very passionately writing it in the moment, but i very quickly
            spiraled into a sort of emotional mess as i went on. at some point
            i stepped away to do something else, and i came to a nice realization
            that changed my mind about what i was writing about. i felt bad when
            i was initially writing ("before" section), but i feel good now ("after"
            section). i don't want to proofread this (you can see the [TODO] portions
            where i say something incomplete or otherwise non-representative of my
            true ideas, but i don't really want to return to it), so enjoy my weird 
            unfinished thoughts on a topic that gave me lots of distress. read the 
            end ("after") to see a more clear picture of my feelings! :+)
          </p>
          
          <h3>Before</h3> 
        
          <p>
            i've been having a problem over the past few weeks (well,
            longer than that, but its been an especially large problem lately)
            and i'm not sure how to resolve it. so i'm making this post to sort
            of talk things through. to preface: if you're struggling with things 
            mentally, then you probably shouldn't read through this post.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            the issue is: how do you justify ... anything. so i finished reading 
            this book on string theory (named "the elegant universe") and it was
            very fun! super good book for anyone looking to learn more about 
            physics development (especially those occurring around the 1980s, which
            is when string theory was becomming more popular). though it emphasized
            a few talking points that have got me thinking.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            two things you may learn in elementary school are "everything in the
            world is made up of atoms" and "the sun is eventually going to explode
            in a billion years". if you think deeply about these things, you'll 
            realize they're secretly saying <i>from the perspective of the 
            universe</i> "our problems exist on a level of abstraction that is 
            ultimately insignificant" and "none of the things you care about now 
            truly matters." (note the importance of the "from the perspective of
            the universe" part, which i'll talk about more in a second.)
          </p>
          
          <p>
            you probably don't particularly care about these two statements since
            you learn them in elementary school, and i didn't care about them either...
            until i read this book. those same two questions kind of got rephrased
            into "each type of subatomic particle is derived from the same basic 
            stuff called 'strings'" and "one theory of the universe is that the 
            big-bang occurred in the center of a black hole, so we can imagine the 
            universe is simply an optimization program designed to maximize the 
            liklihood of black holes forming because it leads to more universes 
            (and thus more black holes) forming." for <i>whatever reason</i>, 
            those statements hit me a little harder <i>now</i> than they did
            a few weeks ago.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            so they got me thinking even more: i care a lot about things that 
            <i>really</i> don't matter in the grand scheme of things, right? i mean, 
            from the perspective of the universe, no problems of mine hold any 
            significance. furthermore, the most significant people in the entire
            human existance (e.g., jesus, julias caesar, george washington, albert
            einstein, etc.) AT MOST have a symbolic longevity in the "human experience" of a
            few thousand years. but we're noticing that the further we go back in
            time, the more these humans are degraded from "people" into "concepts",
            which--i feel--kind of undermines the individualism aspect of these people.
            they got me thinking about what i want to do with my life; what motivates me,
            and if my motivations are really significant. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            although, i can feel you rolling your eyes when you read this post. 
            "but sophie", you may say, "your arguments don't make a lot of sense 
            for any number of reasons!" let's go through the basic counterarguments.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            first: "your actions are significant because they impact other people 
            around you." so from the perspective of the universe, there is nothing
            that intrinsically separates a human from any other object (in fact, 
            the notion of "object" is itself too blurry to hold any importance).
            the complexity of a human is negligible compared to the complexity of 
            a galaxy. should a human be considered more important than a star? 
            a star consists of a simpler collection of atomic constituents, but 
            the movement of a star on an atomic level is arguably just as complex
            as the movements of signals in a human brain (and furthermore, with
            string theory, we can no longer say "the star consists of simpler
            atoms" since "all atoms are fundamentally the same"). if i have a lever that
            either kills a human or destroys a star, there is nothing <i>intrinsically</i>
            more important about the human than the star, so why do i personally 
            care about the human more than i do the star?
          </p>
          
          <p>
            in an ethics class i took last year, i wrote an essay about a similar
            topic to the above, and i noted that "the one factor that is fundamentally
            important about humans is their emotions. we can reduce the emotional 
            state of a human to a number (e.g., +1 for happy, -1 for sad), and thus
            we can internalize the 'goal' of a human to 'maximize this value' and 
            to increase the net happiness of the world". i went on to argue the 
            difficulty of convincing an AI of this argument (which is something 
            Dungeon Meshi explores a bit, if you've read it!): the AI would simply
            respond "in order to maximize happiness, i must maximize the chemical
            that leads to happiness, which requires forcibly restraining every human
            (initially, a large decrease in happiness, bad) and then pumping 
            dopamine/oxytocin/etc. into everybody (a huge gain in happiness over an
            indefinite time period)! by forcing births of more humans, i can lead 
            to MORE dopamine generators, which further maximizes this value!" this
            argument appears nonsensical, but <i>how else</i> can you convince
            an AI to make humans as happy as possible? it's difficult to communicate
            ideas like this on a fundamental level because humans operate on such 
            weird zones of abstraction where this idea seems "bad", for some 
            unexplainable reason. (in this case, you could have the AI maximize 
            both short-term <i>and</i> long-term happiness rather than just one or
            the other, but it would still reguardless need a more concrete way to 
            interpret happiness rather than just the existance of chemicals.)
          </p>
          
          <p>
            second: "your actions may not be significant in the super-duper-long-term, 
            but aspiring that is meaningless. you should instead aspire to be a good
            person in the short-term (e.g., your individual lifespan)." this is a nice
            idea, and its also incredibly manageable! everyone on earth can aim to be 
            a good person, and work towards making themselves loved and cared about 
            by others and mourned when they die. the problem of the "i wanna be like
            einstein" idea that i said above is that if <i>everyone</i> on earth has this
            same idea, then it will quickly lose its meaning. we can't view everybody
            as equally significant! i probably cant fit the identity and accomplishments of 
            more than a few hundred people in my head, let alone a few MILLION or BILLION
            people! but this collides with another idea i mentioned earlier, how significant
            people are "summarized" in this fashion and reduced to "symbols" (e.g., 
            how einstein is reduced to a symbol representing a "scientist", rather than 
            that of an actualized, living person). so this counterargument--that you
            should try to be significant only within your lifetime, only to a few 
            small handfulls of people--is nice.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            but this runs into a similar issue: why does it matter? [TODO]
          </p>
          
          <p>
            another problem is one that lots of people joke about: how would the world
            be different if 9/11 didn't happen? 9/11 led to the deaths of several thousands
            of people (i mean, not to mention the undoubtedly <i>millions</i> of others
            that were killed or otherwise personally affected by the aftermath), but america
            would have been at least slightly different had it not occurred. ignoring the 
            many, many cultural, political, and sociological effects and instead focusing
            solely on airplane security as a tiny example, we can see direct changes to 
            security practices that were implemented as a consequence of the event occurring.
            although it's known that lots of these practices are instances of "security theatre" (e.g., 
            in that they are not meant to stop violence, but merely to be a deterrent and only
            appear as if it would work in stopping threats), its not difficult to argue that
            at least <i>some</i> airplane-related attacks have been prevented as a result. 
            surely genuine terrorists could find a way to slip through the cracks, but 
            <i>realistically</i> at least one threat was prevented due to these measures.
            as such, we can argue that there is at least some possibility that the world has
            <i>improved</i> as a result of 9/11 taking place. if it helps, you can imagine 
            some butterfly-effect sequence of events not taking place due to some potential
            terrorist being stopped at the pre-check gates.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            this exercise is meant to show that "if something bad can lead to good things 
            happening (e.g., a small dip in 'global happiness' can lead to a large increase
            at a later time), then the inverse must be the case as well. this has been
            talked about many times by any number of politicians on every hot-button political
            topic, like "we can't give a universal basic income because it will prevent 
            people from working", or "we cant implement harm reduction approaches like 
            syringe access programs because they will cause more people to start doing
            harmful activities when they wouldn't have otherwise". (note that lots of these
            are a matter of personal opinion, which is a different discussion.) these
            conversations can boil down to one topic: "a person can work very very hard to
            improve the world, and they may be able to improve one small part of it, but
            there's always the possibility they inadvertedly harm the world much more than
            they initially intended."
          </p>
          
          <p>
            now this is a bleak way of viewing the world! "we shouldn't try to be good because
            we could accidentally do bad!" you may simply respond to this argument with 
            "why drive a car if you could get into a crash at any moment?" of course, the 
            definite answer to this lies in calculating the risk exposure, e.g., a value
            indicating the benefit of an activity weighed against the probability of it 
            occurring, which quantitatively shows that driving a car gives far more benefit
            when considering the likelihood of getting into a crash. reguardless, the 
            problem we're running into is <i>not</i> "how do we maximize benefit"; it's 
            <i>why do we want to maximize "benefit" in the first place,</i> or even 
            more abstractly, <i> what even IS benefit?</i> 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            these are the problems i am encountering. i think these arguments so far have
            been way too abstract for any normal person to follow, so im going to relate
            it back to the real, concrete issues i have been thinking and the thought 
            processes i have been working through. if you had simple answers to the 
            above statements, then please consider the following statements (and give
            me solutions, if you have any!).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            i've been wondering "what do i want to do with my time?" in last week's post
            i mentioned my desire to be a super good scientist; i wanted to change the 
            world for the better, to discover facts about the universe that describe 
            how it operates, to discover new paradigms for problem-solving that benefit
            everybody in the world, but this takes a lot of work to do. so there's two
            problems with this perspective: the first is that i <i>could</i> dedicate
            myself to this goal, working endless nights on reading papers, researching 
            textbooks and attending lectures and seminars of every class i can find, 
            and talking to every professor, politician, businessperson, and scientist i 
            possibly can in order to accelerate my status in society to better 
            position myself to reach this goal, and this would almost certainly lead to
            me becomming among the world's most successful scientists. it would take
            a level of dedication, motivation, willpower, and effort unbeknownst to 
            any person on the planet, but i could physically perform each of these 
            actions. the problem i would encounter is how <i>miserable</i> i would be
            if i definitely decided to follow through with this. this leads to the
            second problem: even if i <i>did</i> accomplish these goals, why would it
            even matter? i would have no friends, i would be a completely different 
            person than i am right now, i would never socialize outside of work or
            do any fun activities, and i would be under so much stress that it would
            make every waking moment a nightmare. and despite all of this effort, it
            could mean that the world becomes a <i>worse</i> place than if i had never
            lived in it at all, despite my absolute best efforts in doing otherwise.
          </p>
            
          <p>
            but my issue with the above is "if not that, then what?" what do i do 
            with my time? it's difficult not to see most actions in life as big
            time-wasters. social media is a huge example of this: i have been able
            to justify social media usage as "interacting with some internet friends",
            but my usage as of late has been a big detriment to my mental health. i've
            been scrolling tumblr and twitter for hours, knowingly throwing away
            my time in order to avoid doing "productive" tasks like reading papers
            and textbooks, but it's been very difficult to tell myself to stop.
            my desire to see drawings of anime girls kissing or my need to bark like
            a dog online are both intrinsic aspects of my personality, and i'm scared
            i will be a different person if i give up these parts of me completely.
            from the context of the "scientist" viewpoint i shared previously, the 
            most beneficial task i can do is to dedicate myself to reading papers and
            not indulging in social media use at all, but would i be the same person
            then? (why do i care about being the same person at all?) 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            the counterargument to this is probably "you should do what makes you happy", 
            but this neglects the brain's ability to change as a result of my dedicated
            actions. <i>i have the complete control over what makes me happy</i>. [TODO]
          </p>
          
          <h3>After</h3>
          
          <p>
            ok, so bad news guys. after i wrote this far i went outside to throw some
            knives and then i ate some yummy salmon and ate a donut with some coffee and
            watched a movie with my parents. and while i was doing that i was thinking
            "what is my justification for doing this? isn't this irrational? why am i
            not working right now? isnt that also irrational? how can i justify anything
            i am doing?" and the explanation i came up with was "im doing this because
            it makes me happy."
          </p>
          
          <p>
            this is echoed in that last paragraph, and really in the last section kind of
            as a whole, where i was circling back onto this idea. there are ways you can
            worm your way out of this interpretation but the core truth that allows any 
            of life to be worth living is that it ultimately makes you feel some abstract
            feeling that you enjoy. the book <i>i am a strange loop</i> talks about the
            brain's existance on the level of symbols, and how causation and explanation 
            can exist on a symbol-level despite the fact they're devised of smaller
            substrates like neurons and synapses, and i think that's a nice explanation of
            the justification for doing anything. "happiness" may be ultimately meaningless
            on the concrete level of atoms and strings, but it remains meaningful on 
            the symbolic basis of emotions.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            while i was doing all those things today, the thought echoed throughout my 
            brain "im doing this because it makes me happy", over and over again. earlier
            today i was on my phone looking at social media, and i was doing it because it
            made me happy. if, in the moment, i could have looked to the future, i may 
            have realized that prolonged usage of my phone would have made me unhappy, but 
            complete removal of my phone would have had the opposite effect i was looking
            for. my brain unfortunately exists on the irrational level of abstract symbols,
            and i am a slave to their operation in a space devoid of the rigorous logic i 
            may want to live in, but i must continue to live in them regardless! all actions i
            take can gain meaning when i internalize the phrase "im doing this because it makes
            me happy"; this expression does not need any further explanation or deconstruction
            into more basic ideas. if i decide i want to live life as an academic monk,
            abstaining from social interaction to further the pursuit of knowledge, then 
            i can remember that im doing it because it makes me happy. i think thatsa nice 
            way of viewing things.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            unfortunately for the rest of the world, i am the only one that i ultimately 
            am certain about. it is impossible for me to know if my actions will truly benefit
            the rest of the world, but i can focus on the things i <i>can</i> control instead of
            the things i <i>can't</i>. i want to have a partner because i want to hold someone 
            else's hand, and i want to have lots of friends so they can think im smart and
            funny, and i want to work hard in my job so i get lots of recognition and awards, 
            and im doing all of this despite the utter meaninglessness of it all because it makes 
            me happy. thanks for reading; i hope you do things that make you happy as well.
