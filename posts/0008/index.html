        hi. i need to make a post but i dont really want to make a post so im compromising
        by making a post without really having a post concept in mind. this is sophie, 
        straight off the dome. i could talk about the EPR paradox or godel's incompleteness
        theorem but i want to save those for when i can really put in the energy to make a
        super good post.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        first: the school semester started back up for me. i'm in a weird position right now 
        because OOPS!! its too much work. who could have guessed! the thing is, im in the 
        "too much work" zone now, but the hard stuff hasn't even started yet! i have one less
        class this semester (three, instead of four) since i can do "research" as a credit, 
        so it should be easier in theory, but i can already tell its not going to be. i have
        to assist the professor for a few classes, which im thankfully getting paid a lot 
        more to do since i was last semester due to getting a promotion, but it's still a 20 
        hour per week gig. that added on top of classes (another 10 hours a week, <i>minimum</i>), 
        research (definitely more than 30 hours a week), and whatever else i gots to do, it's
        just not looking good for sophie! this isn't even factoring in my other goals of 
        starting that physics-related research project i talked about (would easily be another
        10 hours a week) and reading my one book a week (20 hours) plus one textbook a month 
        (10 hours if we're being generous) goal, AND trying to meet my personal "depression 
        avoidance" goal of gettiing 8 hours of sleep a night, it's just seeming like sophie's
        getting pulled by the seams, here! not counting sleep, that would be 20 + 10 + 30 + 10 +
        20 + 10 = 100 hours of work per week! what! that's like 14 hours per day of stuff to
        do!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        so that number can be amortized a bit. we can pretend like "reading" is a pure-leisure
        activity, something i can do to recover from the rest of the stuff i need to do, so 
        we can move it over from a "job i need to complete" into the "thing that isn't technically
        work" zone (even though i don't feel that's entirely accurate because i would rather be 
        watching dragon ball instead of reading at the end of the day but whatever). also the 
        other stuff is definitely conservative estimates, im definitely not spending a full 
        20 hours assisting the professor EVERY week, along with the other stuff. but regardless,
        i have to be on the tips of my toes this semester!
      </p> 
      
      <p> 
        it's a bit excessive how much stuff i need to do. so far this post has just been me 
        complaining and i dont want to seem like a big complainer who does nothing but complain
        but you know. its my blog i can do whatever i want. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        this semester, the goal should be FOCUS. i need to FOCUS on the things i need to do and
        the time i have to do it. the 20-hours-per-week goal of reading only factors the time i
        spend actually reading my book; any minute i spend walking around or staring off into 
        space is a wasted minute that's taken from the rest of the day. so i need to be going
        for FULL UTILIZATION, 100%!! this sounds impossible, though. but i have been keeping up 
        with my one-paper-a-day goal; i'm about ten days behind because of my idleness
        at the start of the year (come on, sophie!!) but i've been very consistent about reading 
        a paper every day since that point, even reading two papers a day sometimes. i think
        that's impressive! it's like four hours of reading research papers every day! that's gotta
        count for something!
      </p> 
      
      <p> 
        i read two books since my last blog post: "demon copperhead" by barbara kingsolver and 
        "atomic habits" by james clear. the first book was about a boy who's life sucks really 
        bad, and it got me thinking about how my life DOESNT suck, really at all. the boy kind of
        talks about how miserable he is, but also it mentions how one of the indian characters came
        from a place in india that was like a trash heap where they lived in trash, so you're kind
        of thinking "well at least the main character didn't live there, that would REALLY suck"
        so its got me thinking about that in my own perspective. i've got a pretty cozy life!
        its a lot of mental work, but i've got the softest bed and the friendliest stuffed animals
        to come home to every night, and my parents love me and i make yummy food to eat every night
        so it's great! 
      </p> 
      
      <p>
        the second book was cool, too. there was one part about genetics that kind of freaked me out. 
        it mentioned how genetics is a thing that impacts EVERY part of your personality, like to the
        degree where we can KNOW if you're the type of person who likes to go to music concerts based 
        on your genes alone. i mean, WHAT?? genes are that fine-grained?? how much of my life is 
        predetermined by these suckers?! and we can go further and say something like, "yesterday i 
        told my sister to study up more about trigonometry so she can do better on her math test, 
        but what if she LITERALLY CAN'T EVER do good at trigonometry because her brain is PHYSICALLY
        MESSED UP?" i know the book didn't imply that, but it also didn't say the degree to which 
        genes impact this stuff. i should probably read more about it, but i have to really think
        about how easily some stuff comes to me and how much more difficult it may be for other 
        people to do the same things. from my perspective, "just put in more hard work and you'll get
        it eventually" is a normal thing to think in regards to math, but that's all gonna change if
        it turns out some people's brains are physically wired differently to not be able to understand
        math the same way as me.
      </p> 
      
      <p> 
        but anyways. im reading "guns, germs, and steel" by james diamond this week. it's 450 pages and
        will take a lot of effort and focus to finish on time, but i will do it. im trying to be the 
        worlds smartest girl, after all! that kind of job doesn't come easy to other people, but im 
        gonna make it happen! i just need to keep that goal in my little noggin. FIGHT ON! FIGHT ON!
        even though sometimes its so difficult it makes me wanna lay down at my desk and sleep for
        one week straight! FIGHT ON! FIGHT ON! if anyone can do it, it's sophie! sophie, the 
        incredible! sophie, the invincible! weaker creatures would have cowered at the mention of tasks
        such as these, but not sophie! the world's strongest! the world's bravest! the world's last hope!
        sophie! sophie! sophie!
