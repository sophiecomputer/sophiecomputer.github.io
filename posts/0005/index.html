        <h2>January 1, 2024 | 11:45 PM ET</h2>
    
          <p> 
            HAPPY MEW YEARS.!! welcome to ... 2024: the year of sophie. (according
            to the sophie calendar & sophie culture, every year is the year of
            sophie). this year was very eventful for me so i am going to summarize
            the big parts and give my goals for next year. :+)
          </p>
          
          <h3>EVENTS</h3> 
          
          <p>
            in terms of "things that happened to me", the biggest thing was that i
            started graduate school! i want to get a phd next so this is the 
            stepping-stone BEFORE that. i could have technically started a phd right
            away but i didnt want to move that quickly through school, and in 
            hindsight im REALLY GLAD i get to have this time to sort of think
            things through. i still don't know what i want to research! if you 
            asked me a year ago, i would have confidently told you "programming
            languages and compilers", but now i'm leaning a lot more towards
            computer architecture (especially relating somehow to physics! i 
            think that would be relating to emerging systems that utilize 
            hardware in non-traditional ways, e.g., with quantum computers, 
            systolic arrays, processing-in-memory, accelerators in general, etc.).
          </p>
        
          <p>
            i realized my school kind of sucks. i get nearly perfect scores on 
            everything, but i dont study particularly hard. on one test, i got
            a 60 on the final but the class got on average a 30, which made my
            grade an A after the professor curved it. that makes me feel bad! i want
            to be in a learning environment where everybody is cutthroat, eager
            to show their stuff, doing all-nighters every day, competing with each
            other, and everything like that! i'm procrastinating on assignments
            and i dont feel like i've learned not to because procrastinating is 
            so successful. i dont want a learning environment like that. my dream
            is to make it into a really competitive school for my phd so i have 
            more of an incentive to work very hard and really COMPETE against my
            classmates. hopefully i find a good school this year! 
          </p> 
          
          <p> 
            alongside that, my favorite tv show EVER, The Owl House, ended! i got
            to watch the finale live. it was the most amazing experiences of my 
            whole life, getting to watch this show as it was happening, being in 
            the community, stuff like that. i think the owl house was the first
            thing i would genuinely call a "hyperfixation" because of how much it
            occupied a spot in my brain. i also thing i rewatched that entire show
            from start to finish 10 entire times (and like, paying attention to the
            show on each rewatch, not doing anything else in the background. its still 
            my favorite show even though i haven't watched it since late july. i
            think i want to watch it again soon!). there was a time for a few months
            straight where every night i would come home from school at like 9:30pm,
            i'd make dinner really quick and watch an episode of the show with it,
            then shower and go to sleep before waking up at 7am to go to school. it 
            was such a consistent routine for me that i honestly loved it. i think
            i was more productive during that time, and im not really sure why. it
            was nice. i love the owl house even though i dont watch it any more; it
            still holds an incredibly special place in my heart!
          </p> 
          
          <p>
            final big thing was the gender update. i changed my pronouns to "every 
            pronoun" which didn't really mean anything to anybody except me. really
            its just the same as saying "genderfluid" and saying i use "any pronoun"
            but it was a slight semantic shift that sort of encapsulated a new 
            personality/paradigm change for me. alongside that i wore a skirt once
            in public and it was very fun because i was with other genderfluid people.
            a few of the people were very nice and definitely wanted to hang out more with me
            but i was (and still am) WAY too shy to create any plans to hang out so that
            sort of ended there. IM WORKIN ON IT! THIS YEAR I'LL BE BETTER!! I 
            PROMISE!!! (if you're reading this, jojo in particular, hi!! im still too
            shy!! maybe we can hang out this year! ^w^). also 
            i'm re-reading this and i thought i should mention my friend violet somewhere because 
            i think she's awesome hi violet im glad we're friends :+) you're a SUPER cool dog. 
            (here's a little message just for you, in dog language: sniffsniff sniffsniffsniff ... 
            woof, woof woof ... BARK, BARK BARK..! AWROOOOOOO!! sneeze) 
          </p>
          
          <h3>BRAIN</h3>
          
          <p>
            ok the big update this year was this: i have decided i am going to learn
            EVERYTHING. i am determined to be an EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT SCIENTIST. 
            i'm talkin albert einstein level, baby. im gonna be like if john conway
            was genderfluid. the term i discovered and that i really want to embody
            is "polymath", which describes "someone who's sort of an expert in lots
            of diverse subject areas." i want to be the type of person who seems to 
            have infinite insight into every topic, who's able to spout any kind of
            interesting fact about anything, and who is renouned in their field. that
            sounds soooo coool i wanna make it happen. i really love the idea of my
            friends introducing me to other people as like "thats dr. sophie, shes the 
            smart one who knows about what a higgs boson is, he's published papers that
            have made a significant impact in the fields of computer science and 
            physics, they've edited this textbook and have their name in these 
            conference proceedings". it gives me little butterflies thinking about it. 
          </p>
          
          <p> 
            the biggest change this required was reading more. i wasn't really much
            of a reader before like May. i started reading after that. since then, 
            here are (most? all?) the books ive read this year that i remember: 
            <ul>
              <li>Range, why generalists triumph in a specialized world. about why
              you should learn lots of different things instead of focusing on one
              specific thing.</li>
              <li>Anna Karenina. old fiction about russian aristocracy. my moms 
              favorite book.</li>
              <li>Grit, about why "determination" is the most important metric for
              success.</li>
              <li>7 habits of highly effective people, book about communication 
              skills and mindfulness.</li> 
              <li>Magick, Mavericks, and Mayhem, about the history of physical 
              chemistry.</li>
              <li>The Polymath, about the history of polymaths.</li>
              <li>Your Turn to be an Adult, on doing things that adults do, like
              taking control of your situation.</li>
              <li>The Four Agreements, honorable mention. i didnt really like it, 
              it kind of went over my head. about motivation and personalty stuff.
              <li>Bright Side, with my mom, about a girl with cancer.</li>
              <li>None of This is True, another mom book with my mom, about a 
              podcast guest who lies about things. it was fun, one of the side 
              characters is this autistic gamer girl and i thought she was fun.</li>
              <li>Quantum Physics: What Everyone Needs to Know, a more layman 
              perspective to quantum.</li>
              <li>The Ghost in the Atom, interviews with quantum physicists.</li>
              <li>Quantum Physics: Illusion or Reality? more theoretical side of 
              quantum physics.</li> 
              <li>The Elegant Universe, about string theory.</li> 
              <li>Godel, Escher, Bach. god, such a good book. about brains, number
              theory, life, language, programming, intelligence, who knows. probably by 
              favorite book ever.</li>
              <li>I Am A Strange Loop, companion piece to Godel Escher Bach. soooo good.</li>
              <li>The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. this was the longest book
              series on here i feel like these should be four different entries.</li>
              <li>The Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring. yeah im gonna
              do that.</li> 
              <li>The Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers. i also watched all the 
              movies.</li> 
              <li>The Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King. i wish i could 
              scratch my face against aragorn's beard. i want him to pet my hair.</li>
              <li>Computer Architecture, a Quantitative Approach. i FINISHED this textbook, 
              i read it start to finish. its like 1500 pages long! but its extraordinary, it
              really got me interested in computer architecture.</li>
              <li>The Freakin Bible. actually i only started it. im not religious
              i just thought, you know, its like one of the most influential books
              in the entire world. i gotta see what all the fuss is about. although
              FROM A LITERARY STANDPOINT it kind of sucks. i think i see why not 
              many people read it from start to finish. and im reading the king 
              james version which is like the old english version. there's different versions
              that are easier to read but i feel like ive gotta put myself through the
              original if i want the full effect. though from a cultural standpoint
              i feel like im learning a lot, so its a good use of my time. i can definitely
              tell that J. R. R. Tolkien has read the bible because theres lots of similarities
              between his writing style at some points with it.</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>im definitely missing others but those are the big ones i can remember off
            the top of my head.</p> 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            additionally, this is the year i actually started reading research papers. 
            i was very, very slow at first, but im really picking up the pace nowadays.
            it's turned out to be an invaluable skill i need to get good at doing.
          </p>
          
          <h3>FUTURE</h3>
          
          <p>
            heres my resolutions. WHAT'S ON THE DOCKET
            FOR SOPHIE'S 2024? 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            1.) MAKE MORE FRIENDS. god. i need to make more IRL friends. i am waaaayyyy too shy.
            i kind of stuck with the same friends from high school and they went off and
            made new better friends but I HAVENT. i especially want--no, NEED--to be friends
            with people who are genderfluid. its driving me crazy. i need to know people who
            are similar to me. i need to introduce myself to other people as "sophie". i
            need to wear a dress in front of other people. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SCIENCE TO
            OTHER PEOPLE WHO CARE!! & I WANT THEM TO TALK ABOUT SCIENCE BACK TO ME!!!! 
          </p>
            
          <p>
            2.) and i need MORE THAN THAT TOO. IS THIS NEXT PART TOO PERSONAL?? WHO CARES!! goal number
            (2) is I AM GOING TO GET A PARTNER THIS YEAR. im talking GIRLFRIEND OR BOYFRIEND OR
            SOME OTHER KIND OF WEIRD-GENDER-FRIEND. i always used to think "people who openly
            yearn for a girlfriend are weird LOL" but SCREW THAT!! IM IN YEARNING TERRITORY,
            BABE! creatures were designed to desire physical companionship. i am a virgin. i 
            have not kissed anyone. i have not TOUCHED anyone. IM (somewhere between 21 and 24) 
            YEARS OLD!! i kind of went through weird emotions these past few weeks because BOTH
            of my siblings have a boyfriend/girlfriend and they spend all of their time together with their partner
            and are best friends and my parents think they fit right in to the family and i was thinking how nice that would
            be. I WANT THAT BUT FOR MY OWN PARTNER!! (note: i have thought of every angle this emotion takes. i have read books over
            human psychology, so i understand the irrationality of desiring things in general, and
            especially see the danger in "i want to have a boyfriend so my family thinks im cool."
            in fact, ive thought about this so much, i'll probably make a blog post entirely about
            it. brains are weird. boyfriends are even weirder because they are SO time consuming.
            how can i justify having a girlfriend if im also trying to be the most successful
            scientist in the world? the best i could come up with is "getting a partner would expand
            my sense of culturedness [in the same way reading classics would expand it] which makes
            me a more well-rounded person which makes me learn better and be more successful". is this
            a weird way of putting things? i'm sure a therapist would love hearing me say this.
            my head hurts. i want to touch someones chest and i want them to touch mine. there is 
            no rational explanation for this, the most successful thing i could do is ignore these
            sensations and go back to reading research papers. i dont know. i feel weird.) i dont
            know if i want to have sex but i definitely do want to kiss someone. the important
            thing is i know exact actionable plans i can do to make this happen: next semester i 
            have a list of five school organizations (socialization stuff like book clubs, chess clubs, etc.) to attend weekly meetings of. i will attend every meeting
            this semester, no matter how busy i get with school. i will talk to people and make 
            plans to hang out with others. i will sometimes introduce myself as sophie. i am going 
            to treat "get a boyfriend" as an objective function to optimize (and baby you can call
            me simulated annealing because i am going to approximate the maximum of that sucker even if it kills me).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            3.) GET PUBLISHED. i am working on a paper right now i would be a main author on which will
            definitely get completed by the end of the year. the idea of traveling to a conference may 
            be the scariest thing i can think of, but it needs
            to happen. einstein had no trouble talking to people all over the world, and neither will
            i. i will present my research in front of accomplished people. i think i am going to melt
            into slime though. sometimes i like to lay on my floor when things get too complicated and
            scary. but floor-time is a temporary solution to the terrifying ordeal of being perceived 
            by other people.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            4.) READ MORE. specifically, my reading goals are: 1 PAPER A DAY, 1 BOOK A WEEK, 1 TEXTBOOK
            A MONTH. this is extremely (EXTRAORDINARLY) ambitious, but i realized that i have WAAAAY too
            much stuff i want to read. this will require a level of focus, determination, and motivation
            that is, frankly, quite unlikely for any human to possess, but thankfully im not human. i 
            am going to use this blog as motivation for reading: i'm adding a segment to every blog post
            updating you on the stuff i read. by the end of the year, the next "Sophie in Review 2024" 
            will contain a very well formatted numbered list of everything ive read. STAY TUNED.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            other miscellaneous things, like write a story (maybe soon, even. i have an idea about some one 
            who is not human and is pretending to be human who also likes science. no its not projecting or
            an allegory for being autistic), play an instrument (maybe violin! i have
            a big fantasy of wearing a dress and playing a few pieces in front of other people in a recital
            setting, maybe with my beautiful boy/girlfriend playing on the piano, and my body is perfect
            and my boobs look great in the dress), make a game (i have two
            game ideas planned, one about hatsune miku and her dad Columbo solving a mystery, and another
            about Godel's Incompleteness Theorem), learn a new language (lots of work but we'll see if i
            can combine it with goal 2 above, like if i can use it to socialize), etc.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            and thats all, folks! this year was fun. there were other things i should have probably 
            mentioned, like how i used social media dramatically less this year (15 minutes a day instead
            of like two hours a day at the start of last year!!). also my favorite music genre is vocaloid. 
            i have a playlist i can send other people. thanks for sticking with me!! here's to another 
            12 months of SOPHIE!!!
          </p>
