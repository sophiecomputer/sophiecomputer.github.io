        Hi! I moved apartments a few days ago, but I've also been thinking a
        lot about privacy. If you're interested in staying anonymous on the
        internet (and the difficulty of doing that), then read on!
      </p>

      <h2><center>Apartment</center></h2>

      <p>
        A few days ago, I moved into a new apartment with one of my friends.
        We've been friends for a long time, so I was very excited to be moving
        in with them. In my previous apartment, I was very antisocial and never
        wanted to talk with my roommates unless I had to. This had the
        consequence of preventing me from using the communal kitchen ever, so
        most of my food was microwaved. As such, I was looking forward to
        finally learning how to cook on my own in my new apartment, and I've
        made a few things that turned out very well including broccoli, brown
        rice, and eggs!
      </p>
      
      <img src="resources/0003/broccoli.jpg" alt="A yummy-looking bowl of
      broccoli with cheese. The image is very compressed." style="width: 50%;
      height: auto; max-width: 600px;" class="center">
      
      <img src="resources/0003/rice.jpg" alt="A yummy-looking bowl of
      rice with eggs. The image is very compressed." style="width: 50%;
      height: auto; max-width: 600px;" class="center">

      <p>
        I've been reading Dungeon Meshi, too, which has gotten me even more
        motivated to cook food. If Senshi believes I should cook nutritious
        food, then I'll put more effort into doing it. :+)
      </p>

      <h2><center>Privacy</center></h2>

      <p>
        I've been wondering a lot about my privacy on the internet. I
        especially want to obscure more details about my personal life on here
        because I really don't want any employer or important person see my
        little blog (or even worse, my Twitter account). Who knows what kind of
        things an associate would say if they saw me bark like a dog online!
      </p>

      <p>
        One thing you may have noticed is how poor those images above look.
        They're all noisy and compressed! This is to circumvent <a href=
        "https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210324-the-hidden-fingerprint-inside-your-photos">
        image fingerprinting methods</a> employed within camera hardware that 
        could be used to identify me. This is hard to avoid, but adding noise and 
        compression could help. Additionally, all the metadata from the images 
        are scraped with a linux command-line tool.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may be thining "this is a bit excessive! Nobody would be able to trace
        something like this back to you!" but think back to that guy on TikTok
        who got really popular because he could <a href=
        "https://twitter.com/georainbolt/status/1678519957968109570?s=20">identify 
        the coordinates of places</a> based on an image of it. If a human can do 
        this, why can't an expensive computer with more processing power do the 
        same? Or if they can't do it now, why couldn't they in 20 years?
      </p>
      
      <img src="resources/0003/rainbolt.jpg" alt="A Twitter post, which is quote-
      tweeted by Twitter user rainbolt. He's replying to someone asking him to 
      locate their position from an image, which rainbolt succeeded in by looking
      at each road in Sweden that matched the angle of the road in the picture." 
      style="width: 50%; height: auto; max-width: 600px;" class="center">

      <p>
        The compression on this one was more meant to be silly, but then again...
        is it <em>impossible</em> that this screenshot isn't fingerprinted? A 
        simple example of obvious fingerprinting would be Twitter's UI changing
        slightly per operating system or browser version for compatibility
        reasons; knowing this information could drastically narrow down the
        kinds of people that could have taken this screenshot. We could go
        deeper and say that the screenshot-taking application embeds some
        unique noise pattern into each image to make them uniquely identifiable
        depending on the user who takes them. This could tell you exactly the
        user who took the image (for instance, if my application was registered
        with a certain company, then an investigator could ask that company for
        the identity of the person with this noise pattern), or you could
        connect different images together to a single origin (if I take a
        picture of an image with my phone, sell the phone to someone else, and
        they take innocuous pictures without obscuring their identity, then
        their carelessness could be linked back to me through that
        transaction).
      </p>

      <p>
        This is all extremely unlikely, but not impossible. Even right now,
        every time you take a picture with an iPhone, <a href=
        "https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Technical_Assessment_of_CSAM_Detection_David_Forsyth.pdf">
        a copy is sent to Apple's servers and a hash is made of it</a>. This 
        is currently being used to prevent the sexual exploitation of children, 
        but we have to trust the technology won't be used for other purposes in 
        the future. Imagine if you have a private Twitter account that posts an 
        image that was taken with an iPhone: if a data breach occurs in Apple 
        that causes these image hashes to be released along with the identities 
        of each user who owned their respective images, then a third party could 
        simply compute a hash on the images in your Twitter account and see if 
        they match any hash in the leaked server. This could link your private 
        account to your real name!
      </p>

      <p>
        So far, I've written about privacy as a motivation to prevent potential
        employers from learning about my personal life. A real-world equivalent
        to what I'm writing about is with whistleblowers (an employee who
        anonymously leaks information about a company they work for) and <a href=
        "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/30/hospital-hired-fingerprint-experts-to-unmask-whistleblower-report-finds">
        fingerprinting tactics used to identify them</a>. For example, printers in
        your company could print <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Identification_Code">tiny yellow 
        dots</a> in certain positions that are unique to each printer so that a 
        whistleblower's leaked printout could identify the printer they used. 
        More recently, Tesla admitted to sending emails with <a href=
        "https://theintercept.com/2022/12/15/elon-musk-leaks-twitter/">
        different spacings between words that identify leakers</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A lot of privacy is built on a huge amount of trust. As an example, a
        VPN is a service which obscures your IP address by acting as a
        middle-man to fetch data on your behalf: instead of having your
        computer go to an end server, you instead go through a VPN and have
        them go to the end server, forwarding any data back to your computer.
        Most people think this is a great way to hide your identity well enough
        to pirate things like movies online, but it relies on the trust of the
        VPN service to keep your information private! For instance, the VPN
        could simply scan the network activity and watch for piracy websites to
        be accessed; if any user accesses one, then the service could link
        together your registration information (or payment information, if you
        gave it) with whatever websites you accessed, and could relay this
        information to interested parties. The popular VPN services say they
        don't do this, but how can we be sure?
      </p>

      <p>
        Who can say how easily you could identify me in the future. Maybe this
        whole blog is a mistake, but I'm taking a little gamble in saying it
        isn't. Ideally, there's so much information on the internet that it's
        impossible to distinguish me from a small subset of other people, which
        makes identification unreliable at best. One way to combat this is with
        lies (e.g., I can form alibis by claiming to be at a conference at one
        date when my public employer-accessible accounts say I was actually
        somewhere else, which means any investigator searching for me online
        would have a low confidence in any conclusion they come to), but these
        are difficult to maintain.
      </p>

      <p>
        In any case, the most effective way to enhance your privacy on the
        internet is to be knowledgeable about how systems work. How can your
        choices impact you in the future? Every time you upload something,
        access a website, or show a third party anything, just think about what
        kind of information could be conveyed. In the future, imagine that
        computers will be made with infinite processing power and access to the
        entire breadth of the internet with the singular goal of identifying
        your footprint online. Currently, imagine ways that systems around you
        (like yellow dots on printers, receipts of purchase, and spoken words
        near any Amazon Alexas) could communicate information you wouldn't want
        anyone else to know.
      </p>

      <p>
        In one way, this is exciting! It requires you to be knowledgeable about
        everything around you and everything you use! You need to know every
        aspect of the internet, of electricity and the limits of their
        conveyance, and of the path the garbage you throw out takes through the
        city! It's hard to be anonymous without being extremely intelligent and
        careful, and luckily for you, anyone can be both of these things with a
        bit of effort. I'll be investigating more methods of staying anonymous
        in the future.
