          <h3>Poster Session</h3>
          <p>My school has a group of technology companies which formed a consortium and collectively supports students with research projects, funding, and other stuff, and one of the things they do to bolster a sense of community between us is a poster session. The idea is we would make a big poster of some project we worked on that's tangential to that company's mission statement (e.g., a project about computer architecture for a company that produces computers), we would have the ambassador for the consortium manage the printing of these posters, and we would present it at the campus while they provide a tour and food and stuff. This sounds fun.</p>
          <p>However, none of us want to do this..! The consortium is sort of dying because companies keep not contributing as much towards it, so it's really just one big company now which is actively participating. Also, the students are not very enthusiastic about presenting posters either. If you've never presented a poster before, it consists of a bunch of graduate students standing in front of their poster waiting for people to walk over and ask for a description of the project. The students then try their best to appear engaging and present things in an exciting and informative way, without knowing the technological expertise of the person being presented to (it's equally likely you'll talk to a random finance person than an expert in the exact thing you're presenting, so you need to make your presentation entertaining to both).</p>
          <p>This sounds fine, but what's the outcome we're looking for? In a completely ideal world, a researcher may attend the session and be completely moved by our presentation, offering us an internship as a result. Although, it's more likely this will only happen if the researcher already knows about us... thus, even if we <i>didn't</i> do the poster session, it's relatively likely they would send us an email about the internship opportunity regardless. The next most likely thing is a researcher notices our topic overlaps with something they've been wanting to investigate, so they ask about collaborating with us. However, this runs into the same issue as before, as they would have already done this regardless of the poster session (and also, researchers aren't exactly itching to collaborate with students; considering the size of this company, it's relatively straightforward for them to just collaborate with other researchers that they know personally). The last logical outcome is the enjoyment of the presenters, which <i>I guess</i> is kind of why we're in research at all---besides the promise of money---though I would personally have gained more enjoyment by continuing to work on research instead of presenting it.</p>
          <p>Regardless, I presented this poster and received a nice tour and ate some yummy food. The driving situation is a bit crazy where I'm located; it's not a far distance yet the traffic makes it take much longer than it should be. I don't know how I would like it if I had to make that trip every day. After I presented the poster, I went home and took a nap. I hope I don't do very many poster sessions in the future, but getting outside and interacting with other researchers is probably good to make me more well-rounded.</p>
