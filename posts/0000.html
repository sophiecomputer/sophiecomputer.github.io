        Welcome to the first post on my awesome blog... you will find wonders 
        here beyond your wildest dreams. OBSERVE my autistic little thoughts. 
        WATCH as I bark like a dog. EXPERIENCE my life as we know it. This 
        website has it all, and you're here on the ground floor. Not many people
        can say the same: are you ready to LEVEL UP?
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Here is the format of this website going forward: I will create a blog 
        post <b>at most once a week</b> and <b>at least once a month</b>. You 
        can be updated through the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" 
        href="../feed.xml" style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;
        text-decoration: none; color: #795CB2;">RSS <img src="../rss.png" 
        width="15"></a>. My interests (at the time of writing this document) 
        include: programming, being autistic, barking and/or meowing, being 
        transgender, animated TV shows geared towards pre-teens (The Owl House, 
        Steven Universe, etc.), high-dexterity video games (ULTRAKILL, Dark 
        Souls, etc.), and academia.

        My name is Sophie Computer, my pronouns are they/it, I am between 20 
        and 23 years old, and I live in the United States. I have a Bachelor's 
        degree in computers, I am currently attempting to get a Master's degree 
        in computers, and I want to get a PhD in <a target="_blank" 
        rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">
        compilers</a>. I work in a research lab, I have published a paper 
        before, and I read lots of papers every day. I want to learn everything 
        in the entire world.
      </p>

        I love "<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel">reinventing 
        the wheel</a>". I like to create things that are as low-level as 
        possible. When I'm programming, I would rather spend a lot of time 
        recreating utilities than use an existing library to do the same thing. 
        The best way for me to learn something is to do it hands-on: instead of 
        using a fancy template for this website, I'd rather create the whole 
        thing by myself! Also, sorry for how the website looks ... NOT! This 
        website rocks. It probably is not great accessibility-wise though. Send 
        me a message if you know how to improve it. I'll be changing basically 
        everything about this website in the future. 
      </p>

        I am very bad at communicating, but I'm getting better! I like to meet 
        similar-minded people. If you have similar interests as me, send me a
        message. :+)
