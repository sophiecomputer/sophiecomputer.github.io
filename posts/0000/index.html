            Welcome to the first post on my awesome blog... you will find wonders 
            here beyond your wildest dreams. OBSERVE my autistic little thoughts. 
            WATCH as I bark like a dog. EXPERIENCE my life as we know it. This 
            website has it all, and you're here on the ground floor. Not many people
            can say the same: are you ready to LEVEL UP?
          </p>
          
          <p class="main-text">
            Here is the format of this website going forward: I will create a blog 
            post <b>at most once a week</b> and <b>at least once a month</b>. You 
            can be updated through the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" 
            href="../feed.xml" style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;
            text-decoration: none; color: #795CB2;">RSS <img src="../rss.png" 
            width="15"></a>. My interests (at the time of writing this document) 
            include: programming, being autistic, barking and/or meowing, being 
            transgender, animated TV shows geared towards pre-teens (The Owl House, 
            Steven Universe, etc.), high-dexterity video games (ULTRAKILL, Dark 
            Souls, etc.), and academia.

            My name is Sophie Computer, my pronouns are they/it, I am between 20 
            and 23 years old, and I live in the United States. I have a Bachelor's 
            degree in computers, I am currently attempting to get a Master's degree 
            in computers, and I want to get a PhD in <a target="_blank" 
            rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">
            compilers</a>. I work in a research lab, I have published a paper 
            before, and I read lots of papers every day. I want to learn everything 
            in the entire world.
          </p> 
          
          <p class="main-text"> 
            I love "<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel">reinventing 
            the wheel</a>". I like to create things that are as low-level as 
            possible. When I'm programming, I would rather spend a lot of time 
            recreating utilities than use an existing library to do the same thing. 
            The best way for me to learn something is to do it hands-on: instead of 
            using a fancy template for this website, I'd rather create the whole 
            thing by myself! Also, sorry for how the website looks ... NOT! This 
            website rocks. It probably is not great accessibility-wise though. Send 
            me a message if you know how to improve it. I'll be changing basically 
            everything about this website in the future.

            I am very bad at communicating, but I'm getting better! I like to meet 
            similar-minded people. If you have similar interests as me, send me a
