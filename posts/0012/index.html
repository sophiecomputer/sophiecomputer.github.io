            hello..! things have been bad lately. I have not been feeling good. this post will be about several 
            things that have been happening with me. read on..!...... if you dare..!
          </p> 
          
          <h3>(Borat Voice) My Life!!</h3> 
          
          <p> 
            I finished my semester. I found out my grades, they're an A and a B. Which is great! i was expecting 
            worse. i also finished grading things. i was very late and the grading at the end wasnt the best but 
            im glad i finished it. but things have been bad in other ways. first, I have made no progress on my 
            research projects. i do not want to do anything. my advisor wants to meet with me tomorrow and i dont 
            know why. i feel horrible. i need to talk with professors about advising, i need to sign up for my 
            classes next semester, form my research committee, and apply for jobs and PHD programs. this all takes
            a lot of work, and i do not want to do any work. I should also be a teaching-assistant for the summer
            semester which starts in six days and i have not yet been contacted about who my professor/class will
            be. i received and signed the offer letter, but this is worrying. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            besides that, i was thinking about the 8-hour work-day. if i want to be the best in the world, i need 
            to work more than eight hours a day. but lately i have been thinking about how much i do not want to 
            do work. how can i be the best in the world with a work ethic like this? this led me to thinking about,
            the thing,...you know the thing that circulates on twitter a lot among trans women, its an image thats
            like a timeline and it shows the progression "gifted kid -> burnt out loser -> trans girl" or something. 
            obviously this doesnt apply to me bcuz i was in the trans girl stage like half a decade before the burnt
            out loser stage, but ive been hoping this burnt-out feeling isnt just my entire life now.
          </p> 
          
          <p> 
            like, you know how many people say "im gonna get a job for a few years then go back to school to finish 
            my PHD or masters" and then they get cozy in their job and then never go back to school? this happens to 
            so many people its like, i know three people this applies to. its just cuz things are so difficult. in 
            general. why dont i just try and get a normal job and make a lot of money (or even just a regular amount
            of money you know...) or even, why dont i just get a phd at my current school. i definitely dont need to 
            apply to anywhere crazy. idk. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            but im not going to do that. i know i will feel very bad with myself if i dont get a phd at the worlds 
            best location. i need to do it. it matters a lot to me, so im going to make it happen. i just feel very
            bad at the current time, i know i wont feel bad forever. but i dont know why i feel bad, and what i can 
            do to make myself feel better..! arrghhhhhhhhh......
          </p> 
          
          <h3>I Have Got To Get More Serious</h3> 
          
          <p> 
            all this moping has got me thinking about little witch academia. here's a (non-spoiler theres no spoilers
            here well theres a little spoilers i guess but it wont affect your enjoyment of the show or anything) little 
            section on little witch academia. theres this girl named akko kagari whos the main character and she started
            doing magic right at the start of the show, shes like 16 or whatever. shes magically inept, she cant do a 
            single spell. her rival is this rich girl named diana cavendish. ok so diana SUCKS shes mean and preppy and 
            thinks shes better than anyone else. she gets her own fancy room cuz shes rich and gets her own heated shower
            and fine linens and everything. akko hates her because diana is like Magic Conservative and wants magic to 
            be based on tradition and wants magic to be done the same way its always been done, while akko wants it to
            be new and exciting. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            one thing i love a lot about little witch academia is that diana is always better than akko in magic. diana
            is shown putting a lot of dedicated effort into learning magic, she's shown studying tomes and practicing in
            her room, and she's had magic lessons since she was a young child, and she's very focused and always spends her
            time wisely. Akko also puts in a lot of effort, but shes not having a lot of success because (1) she just 
            started out and (2) she has trouble focusing on practice even though she really really wants to. there's also
            other reasons they differ in magical abilities but you should watch the show since im avoiding spoilers.
          </p> 
          
          <p>
            why am i talking about this? its because, like... how much would it suck for akko to be better at magic than
            the girl who has put in a million more hours of effort into it? diana has shown to be fluent in a dead language
            and she knows some spells better than the teachers, but its not something that comes naturally to her. she
            has a bookshelf of textbooks and stuff and shes constantly reading them, so of course she should be better at
            magic, right. akko cant sit still long enough to read a book, so her practice with magic is more similar to 
            throwing herself at a wall over and over, waiting for the magic to come to her. a big message of the show is
            that akko should try and do things HER way instead of trying to copy the traditional method, and its sweet and
            all but i love how akko is just not as good at magic as diana is. Akko is shown to be better at SOME areas 
            like transformation spells (since her idol was super good at them and she wants to be like her idol) and diana
            is NOT good at those types of spells because they're the most unserious gimmick-y kind of magic, definitely not 
            something an astute high-class witch should be practicing! 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            when i look at my current situation, i kind of like how much im... idk, how im kind of not doing good in school
            right now, and how im having opportunities slip by me. its like, "if i put in the effort, i could fix my current
            situation..! of COURSE im failing right now, im just not serious enough..! i need to be like diana and really put
            in the effort, really try and make things better for myself, and then i'll be able to succeed!!!" i know its a 
            weird way of thinking, since diana definitely had a tremendous amount of luck in being born in a rich environment
            and at least having the genes that allow her to sit and read a book to learn stuff, compared with akko who is 
            very incapable of learning in that way.

            my roommate and i also watched a little bit of yugioh GX, and theres this part where like, one of the bad guys 
            challenges one of the good guys to a duel. The bad guy destroys the good guy's deck and the good guys like 
            "aaarghh! how will i win now!!" and then still goes to the tournament. then its revealed the good guy actually
            had five other decks, each one themed after a different playstyle, and then he chose a deck that was specifically
            built to counter the bad guy's deck. so of course he wins, its not even a fair competition, the good guy destroys
            the bad guy completely. and the bad guys like "nooooo..this isnt fair..!" but this is the same thing ive been 
            talking about with the little witch academia. im GLAD the good guy won in this situation, he's taking this duel 
            a lot more seriously than the bad guy who waltzes into the arena with only one deck. the guy who puts more effort
            into winning should be the one who wins, regardless of how good or bad they are. there's other shows similar to this,
            where i really hope the bad guy wins because they've obviously put a lot more effort into winning compared to the
            good guy who we're supposed to be cheering for. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            so thats all i wanted to say on this topic. i have got to get more serious. i have a problem (that i;ll probably
            talk more about in a future blog post) where im too focused around routines and the infinity. here's my issue: lets 
            say i want to start working out. i'll say "i should wake up early tomorrow to work out". then i'll say "but i wont
            always be able to wake up early; some times i'll need to sleep in because i wont get a lot of sleep". and then i'll 
            end with "i should never work out because there will be some times i won't be able to wake up early". my problem is 
            i keep thinking in terms of very long time frames; i wont start habits if i know i cant keep them FOREVER without fail.
            im trying to fix this but i dont know how. any ways i dont want to write any more so thanx for reading... GOOP BYE...
