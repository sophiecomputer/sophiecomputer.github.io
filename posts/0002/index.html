      <p>
        Hi! It's been a few months since my last post. I'll explain that here! 
        I'll also talk about some books I've been reading, including "Magick, 
        Mayhem, and Mavericks", "Anna Karenina", "Range: Why Generalists 
        Triumph in a Specialized World", "Grit: The Power of Passion and 
        Perseverance", and "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People".
      </p>
 
      <h2><center>Update</center></h2>
 
      <p>
        Last entry, I had big long post about something very important to me, 
        and I set a sort of mental precedent to carry that level of effort out 
        forever, but that makes for a very difficult writing environment. 
        Instead, I'm gonna stick to the once-a-week format of these posts, and 
        not set any strict word- or effort-requirement I previously imagined. 
        If a post has only a few sentences in it, then that's fine by me!
      </p>
  
      <h3>Learning</h3>

      <p> 
        Since the last entry, some very big personal developments happened! The 
        biggest was my desire to LEARN EVERYTHING. I made a personal goal to 
        read much more frequently, and I've about gotten to the point where I 
        can read one book a week! This was spurred by reading "Magick, Mayhem, 
        and Mavericks", which I'll talk more about later in this post, but it 
        really encouraged me to try and be my best possible self. 
      </p>
 
      <p>
        Books like "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" motivated me to 
        employ a set of activities to organize my goals, and one of these goals 
        was to stop using social media. Previously, I was spending a 
        significant amount of my time on social media (at least several hours a 
        day), and I didn't really have anything to show for it. It was fun, but 
        I noticed that I wasn't remembering anything I was seeing. I would 
        scroll through hundreds of images of characters, or read thousands of 
        words detailing updates to games or politics, and I wouldn't be able to 
        recall any of it even immediately after reading it. It was as if the 
        time I spent just vanished. 
      </p>
  
      <p>
        I thought about the motivators for me using social media, and it mainly 
        came to keeping in touch with friends. I liked to save funny posts to 
        my notes app and then message them to my friends, and if I stopped 
        using social media I would also drastically reduce the amount of 
        conversation I was having with my friends. Considering my current 
        (in)ability to socialize with other people, this seemed like an issue. 
        I didn't want my friends to forget about me! Although, I came to the 
        conclusion that if friendships required exchanging Twitter posts to be 
        maintained, then it was probably a very fragile friendship to begin 
        with. As such, I should try to have better interactions with people and 
        actively engage with friends directly rather than doing so indirectly 
        through posts! I'm still working on that part, but I've freed up so 
        much more time to do other things I really feel happy about, like 
        reading (but more on that later). 
      </p>
 
      <h3>Gender</h3>
 
      <p>
        Another small update was that a few months ago, I wore girl clothes 
        outside for the first time! It was a simple black shirt with a black 
        skirt, since I remembered a maxim that "everybody looks good in black", 
        and it was to people I knew were LGBTQ+ friendly, so it was very 
        low-stress in general. The experience was great, and I'm very proud of 
        myself for putting myself out there like that. I'm still trying to be 
        more outgoing, and I have a few friendships I'm trying super hard to 
        motivate myself to continue, but small steps are being made!
      </p>
 
      <p>
        Also, I changed my gender (again)! Previously my pronouns were 
        "they/it", and I sort of mentally bounced around why I was so attached 
        to this. I found out that, in my mind, "they/them" was for conveying my 
        gender was ambiguous, and "it/its" was to possibly communicate my 
        gender was more abstract to me than a simple label. After thinking more 
        about it, I took these concepts to the logical extreme by adopting new 
        pronouns: "EVERY pronoun", in fact! Genderfluid people tend to have 
        "any" pronouns, but I wanted a word that better conveyed how I felt 
        about myself. The example I thought of was when someone asks you what 
        you want for dinner: if you reply "anything", it gives off this feeling 
        of indecision or passiveness; but if you reply "EVERYTHING", that gives 
        big vibes of confidence, extroversion, and personal-understanding! It 
        communicates the same outcome as "any pronouns", but it feels more 
        personalized and "Sophie-like". So there you have it: I'm Sophie, with 
        EVERY pronoun. 
      </p>
 
      <h2><center>Projects</center></h2>
 
      <p>
        I was in a fairly busy place during the last scheduled blog entry. I 
        had two big projects I needed to complete for school, which each 
        involved turning in big 10-page conference-formatted reports. Each 
        project was to be completed over the entire semester and could be done 
        in a group of up to 4 people, but I decided to complete it alone and 
        mistakenly started working on it during the last two weeks of the 
        semester. I was understandably a bit frazzled, and spend several days 
        working turbo-mode on projects I wasn't even confident would be 
        finished in time. In the end, everything turned out great, and I'm glad 
        I got to use them as a learning experience in both avoiding 
        procrastination and in implementing a cohesive project.
      </p>
 
      <h3>Deep Learning</h3>
 
      <p>
        The first project was over an implementation of a deep learning model. 
        The class was simply an introduction to the field of deep learning, and 
        it required a project that sufficiently demonstrated understanding of 
        the domain. Due to my previous interest in programming languages, I 
        thought it would be interesting to develop a programming language—with 
        an interpreter and all—entirely using deep learning models. Each 
        component part of the model was proven to be possible via existing 
        research in the field, so there was no worry of whether or not I could 
        successfully complete it. It had an LSTM model parse user-inputted 
        strings containing simple commands, a fully-connected model to apply 
        soft attention given the same inputted commands, and an RNN per 
        instruction (e.g., one RNN for addition, one for subtraction, etc.) to 
        execute the command. As a result, the user could input a string (like 
        "SUB 145 62"), the LSTM would parse it to get each operand, the 
        fully-connected model would determine which RNNs to activate, and the 
        RNNs would use the operands to calculate the instruction.
      </p>
 
      <p>
        The gimmick of the model was that the RNNs needed to each be trained to 
        essentially transform each operand into their respective results, and 
        they do this by learning an algorithm. The algorithm may be very 
        simple, like how the "AND" instruction simply scans a bit-stream and 
        enables bits in the output which have associated bits enabled in the 
        input, but I had an automatic training procedure set up on my computer 
        to train each model overnight. Fortunately, the project turned out very 
        well, and my presentation to the class received the highest grade 
        despite being created last-minute by only one person. Lots of people 
        came up to me after class to ask me questions about it, and I was very 
        happy with the outcome.
      </p>
  
      <h3>Parallel Processing</h3>
  
      <p>
        The second project was over parallel processing. This required 
        implementing a program that contained many threads that collaborate on 
        a task with lots of synchronization and inter-communication. Something 
        involving the GPU seemed to be ideal for this considering my background 
        in GPU programming, but I instead opted to implement my own polyhedral 
        compiler that performs automatic parallelization of code. This turned 
        out to be a very difficult task which I was not entirely confident I 
        could finish in time. Polyhedral compilation requires lots of math to 
        create, and I was a bit naive in thinking I could accomplish it without 
        fully understanding the required theory.
      </p>
 
      <p>
        The project itself was made in C, mainly because I'm a big fan of C and 
        hate all the bells and whistles of C++ (though it's more realistic to 
        say that I don't know enough about C++ to properly utilize it). 
        Polyhedral compilation involves a bundle of dependencies to convert the 
        code between different formats and to handle the basic operations, so 
        the project required installation of CLooG, Candl, Clan, and OpenSCoP. 
      </p>
        
      <p>
        There's around 800 lines of code for extracting strings from input 
        source files and preprocessing them with the libraries, but the main 
        ordeal is creating a special integer matrix to transform the code to a 
        new format. The transformation matrix is typically created through some 
        fancy linear algebra, and there's a dozen papers that give different 
        hints on how you can do that, but it was far too time consuming for me 
        to learn the foundation of the domain well enough to implement it in a 
        non-abstract way. Therefore, I instead did a process of randomly 
        generating transformation matrices (a process that is extremely 
        ill-advised in a genuine compiler for any number of reasons), and doing 
        an execution of the final optimized files to get the quickest versions 
        that remain semantically correct. The result is a compiler that is not 
        guaranteed to produce efficient code in any reasonable amount of time 
        and with too much boilerplate code that makes polyhedral-applicable 
        code sections difficult to read. Despite this, my professor was very 
        impressed with the project overall, and it also surprisingly received 
        the best grade in the class. It was very fun to program, and I really 
        want to clean it up and see if I can improve it for fun.
      </p>
 
      <p>
        A common theme connecting the two projects was expectations: in both 
        cases I was too intimidated by the project to start early, I rushed 
        through it too quickly, I made big compromises that I felt sacrificed 
        quality, and I somehow received the best grade in the class in spite of 
        everything. I could have avoided the stress by distributing the effort 
        across the entire semester and better tailoring my expectations to the 
        requirements of the projects.
      </p>
 
      <h2><center>Books</center></h2>
 
      <p>
        Boy howdy, have I been reading. At around late May I started reading a 
        bit after noticing a peculiar book in the shelf of a local library, and 
        I came to the realization at the same time that I wanted to be using 
        social media a lot less. More and more books started accruing on my 
        to-do list, and I set a daily reading goal in order to keep up. Now, 
        I've tripled that goal and motivated myself to read one book every 
        week. It's a lot of work, but I'm really enjoying myself a lot more as 
        a result! 
      </p>
 
      <h3>Magick, Mayhem, and Mavericks: The Spirited History of Physical 
        Chemistry</h3>
  
      <p>
        This was the first book I noticed in the library. The title was the 
        intriguing part; I was (and still am) obsessed with the "magic" theme, 
        and anyone that treats science like the mystic, wonderful frontier it 
        really is gets my attention! This book was incredible. It's a history 
        of physical chemistry (the intersection between physics and chemistry), 
        and it's filled with stories of real scientists who made big changes in 
        the world through their findings. It made the first step in making me 
        think of the kind of person I want to be. Many of these people came 
        from humble beginnings or started science especially late in their 
        careers, which got me thinking of the ways I could make a big splash in 
        the science community even without graduating from the 
        best-of-the-best. The big theme they conveyed was "don't worry about 
        how you messed up in the past; think about how you can start moving 
        towards your goal now!" After reading this, I decided to read a lot 
        more books to work towards gaining the elusive title of a "polymath". 
      </p>
 
      <h3>Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World</h3>
 
      <p>
        I found the term "polymath" after watching the movie "Elona Holmes" 
        last year, which made me interested in becoming the type of person who 
        studies every topic in order to learn everything about the world. After 
        Magick, Mayhem, and Mavericks, I remembered the term and searched 
        online for tips on how to become a polymath, discovering this book in 
        the process. It talks about how "range" is a much better quality to 
        strive for rather than strict specialization. A scientist who has a 
        very broad understanding of many different subjects with a 
        moderately-deep understanding of some will fare better than a scientist 
        who knows everything about one extremely specific topic. In other 
        words, a scientist who has perhaps a graduate-level understanding of 
        chemistry, physics, biology, botany, economics, computer science, and 
        five other subjects will be more likely to make a groundbreaking 
        discovery in chemistry than a separate scientist who has 50 years of 
        lab experience in only E. Coli. While the latter scientist will be very 
        helpful in answering problems that apply to their own domain, the 
        former scientist could apply solutions to completely unrelated problems 
        with their wide skillset. 
      </p>
 
      <p>
        My favorite example from the book was this: imagine you are a surgeon 
        who needs to destroy a tumor with a machine that generates directed 
        beams of energy. The beams have a certain amount of energy that can be 
        configured, and they behave like a typical wave (e.g., with 
        constructive and destructive interference). If any beam reaches a 
        certain threshold of energy, it will destroy anything it 
        touches—including healthy cells—but anything lower than that threshold 
        of energy would be harmless to cells. How can you use the machine to 
        destroy only a tumor from inside the body without damaging the skin or 
        surrounding organs? 
      </p>
 
      <p>
        While you consider this situation, here's a completely unrelated story: 
        the commander of an army must attack a stronghold that lies in the 
        center of a well-fortified city. The commander cannot bring their 
        entire army to the attack all at once or they will be detected by the 
        enemy; surprise is essential for this army's success. Although, they 
        have an idea: if they split their army into tiny groups and have each 
        group take a different road, they could reconvene their army at the 
        stronghold at the exact same moment to commence their attack. This plan 
        turned out to be a success, as the army avoided detection and defeated 
        the stronghold with their combined power. 
      </p>
 
      <p>
        Now, returning to the original problem with the surgeon, did you think 
        of a solution? The book Range details an experiment that was carried 
        out with groups of real-life surgeons, and those surgeons who heard the 
        above "unrelated story" were more likely to think of a creative 
        solution to their problem: split the beam into several smaller parts 
        (parts that would be too weak to destroy any cells) and have them 
        combine at the same point inside the body to destroy the tumor. This 
        was a genuine solution to the problem, and a solution surgeons are 
        likely to know from their training and education, but surgeons are not 
        likely to immediately think of this solution on their own without 
        hearing the story. 
      </p>
 
      <p>
        The thesis of the experiment was that "irrelevant" knowledge could be 
        utilized to solve domain-specific problems. Even though the scientists 
        with their specialized knowledge could have thought of the solution, 
        scientists who have breadth and know lots of different "irrelevant" 
        things could convene to new, more optimal solutions. As an aspiring 
        researcher myself who is making it their job to learn new solutions to 
        new problems, this sounds very appealing and motivating to my goal of 
        becoming a polymath, someone with the level of breadth required to 
        solve these problems.
      </p>
 
      <h3>Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance</h3>

      <p> 
        This book was made by a psychologist named Angela Duckworth who was 
        actually mentioned in both Range and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective 
        People. She conducted a very famous experiment on a highly-prestigious 
        and difficult military academy that required top test scores and 
        physical ability. Despite this, the academy—which was only a few months 
        in duration—had a dropout rate of about 30%. Duckworth tried to find a 
        way to predict the dropouts using some metric, and she came to the 
        conclusion that "grit" was the best quality to search for. 
      </p>
 
      <p>
        Rather than "intelligence" or "ability to learn new information 
        quickly", grit was a measure of motivation. If you're someone with a 
        lot of grit, you stick to a task and complete it no matter what the 
        world throws your way. Duckworth gave a quick survey to each new 
        recruit to the academy with simple questions like "how much do you 
        stick to goals once you set them", she found that recruits who ranked 
        high in grit were much less likely to drop out, and that other 
        "success" qualities like intelligence had no correlation to recruits 
        who dropped out. In other words, it didn't matter if you were the 
        smartest in the boot camp, or if you had a recommendation letter from 
        the vice president: if you had the motivation to succeed, it turned out 
        to be impossible to get you to give up, and you were very likely to be 
        successful in the end.
      </p>
 
      <p>
        This was a very big inspiration for me. In the past few months, I was 
        feeling a bit sad and unmotivated. Looking back, it was likely a very 
        bad case of burnout. I was desperate for a solution that would make 
        things easier for myself, and I kept imagining how much better other 
        people must have it than me. I thought that successful researchers 
        wouldn't have experienced burnout like I had, and I needed to stay 
        productive if I wanted to gain success. This book showed that 
        consistency was a much better indicator of success than raw effort. No 
        olympian got to their position with effort alone: they just did the 
        same things all day every day for their entire lives. This was 
        motivating to me because it showed me I didn't need to be at my 100% 
        all the time. As long as I took a step every day toward my goal, I 
        would remain a candidate for success. If I kept an eye looking on the 
        horizon and never gave up on my goal no matter how hard it got, I 
        wouldn't need to worry about falling behind.
      </p>
  
      <h3>Anna Karenina</h3>
 
      <p>
        I found out about this book from my mom. She said this was her favorite 
        book of all time, and the only one she read more than once. It was a 
        bit daunting at first as it was the longest book I've ever read (800 
        pages!), but I can see now why so many people consider it to be one of 
        the greatest books of all time. It was made in 1877 by Leo Tolstoy, the 
        same person who made War and Peace, and it's mainly about a rich lady 
        who cheated on her husband. 
      </p>
 
      <p>
        It's an interesting book because a huge part of it could have been 
        omitted, as lots of little scenes happen that don't contribute anything 
        to the plot. One scene in particular was 30 pages long and featured a 
        hunting trip between a few characters: no characters learned anything, 
        nothing especially interesting happened, and the event was essentially 
        ignored after it occurred; the book is littered with scenes like these. 
        When I first read the book, I didn't have a positive opinion of it for 
        this reason, but after thinking it over a little longer, I completely 
        changed my mind. Anna Karenina is the author's attempt at displaying 
        "humanity" as a confusing, slow collection of irrelevant details about 
        different humans. None of the characters are especially likable, and 
        each contain fatal flaws that make them frustrating to read in their 
        own ways, but this book was one of the best examples of "human" 
        characters I've ever seen. It's easy to get sucked into their lives and 
        to think about them as if they were real, and the "meaningless" scenes 
        are absolutely essential to this effect. When I see a TV show I really 
        like, I've found myself saying sometimes "I wish we had more scenes of 
        these characters relaxing or being happy without conflict" because the 
        characters are always in some conflict in order to keep the show 
        exciting and interesting, and Anna Karenina is a prime example of this 
        in action. Looking back, there's lots and lots of little symbolism 
        occurring throughout the book as well, which I'm sure makes for an 
        excellent re-read, but having it as a standalone book is still 
        wonderful regardless. I'm very glad to have read it, and I have War and 
        Peace on my list of books to read as a result.

      <h3>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</h3>
 
      <p>
        The thing I learned about popular books is that "things that are 
        popular are probably good." I think social media conditioned me to 
        think mainstream things are bad, which made me not want to read 
        "classics" or books that are excessively popular, but every time I read 
        a popular book I'm blown away by the things it teaches me! This book 
        was no exception. It sold over 40 million copies and was considered the 
        best self-help book of the 20th century, and it still holds up 
        tremendously well. It really made me think a lot about myself, and I 
        thought it was super necessary for me to read.

        Each of the 7 habits conveyed in the book were important, but a few 
        ideas were especially impactful to me. The first was the idea to 
        "sharpen your saw," and to consider such an idea as a "moral 
        imperative." The example the author uses is a woodcutter who needs to 
        cut down a tree; they've been working for 6 hours, and a bystander says 
        "your saw has gotten a bit dull, why don't you take a few minutes to 
        sharpen it?" to which the woodcutter responds "I don't have time to 
        sharpen my saw, I'm too busy trying to cut down this tree!" The idea is 
        that there's several things we must consider as necessary when they 
        don't immediately seem so. A few weeks ago during the aforementioned 
        burnout, I had a brilliant idea called "spend all day working, and it's 
        better to do nothing than it is to do something unproductive." At the 
        time, I wanted to read two research papers every day, which took about 
        8 hours of sustained effort and high concentration to do. 
        Understandably, this led to horrible unmotivation, and I would 
        sometimes stare at a wall for 30 minutes because I thought it was 
        better than being on my phone. When I inevitably failed to complete the 
        papers for the day, it would contribute to even more unmotivation and 
        disappointment in myself. With the "sharpen the saw" mentality, I tell 
        myself that regular sleep, exercise, and variation in my tasks with 
        downtime incorporated in my schedule are not just healthy, but 
        completely necessary to maintain productivity. The key idea is to 
        reinterpret a semi-productive task like reading to be "downtime," so I 
        would "relax" while still accomplishing a goal.

        The book contained several other very important ideas to me, including 
        "be proactive" (complete tasks that are not immediately urgent in order 
        to make the future less busy and more productive), "think win-win" 
        (don't treat everything in life as a competition since humans are more 
        productive together), and "seek first to understand, then to be 
        understood" (be more considerate of what other people have to say, 
        don't listen to other people just to wait for the chance to speak 
        yourself, and understand that two people can say different or opposing 
        things while both being correct). I would recommend this book to 
        anybody and everybody; I really think it's changed my perspective on 
        what it means to be productive, successful, and "effective".

        Woof, that's a long post. Other posts won't be this long. I'm gonna try 
        to keep up that once-a-week schedule, so expect much shorter low-effort 
        posts. Message me on discord at "urlslug" (though temper your 
        expectations because I am bad at communicating). Thanks you for tuning 
        in to this edition of: The Sophie Chronicles…
